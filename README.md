# IrregularSpectra.jl

This repository is the software library companion to [Nonparametric spectral
density estimation from irregularly sampled data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00492).

We will populate the repository this week (the week of Monday 03/17/2025) with a
minimum viable product for you to try plugging in locations and measurements and
obtaining an estimator as well as at least basic documentation for doing so.
Over the course of the next couple months as people try and share feedback on
the software, we hope to dial in the interface and present the tool in a way
that has increased protection against
[footguns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun).
