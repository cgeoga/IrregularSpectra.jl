# Basic usage demonstration

Here is a heavily commented demonstration, which can also be found as a plain
code file in `./examples/simple_demo.jl`.

First, let's generate some data. This picks `n=3000` uniform locations on `[a,
b] = [0, 1]` and simulates a Matern process with the chosen parameters at those
values. This package offers the Matern kernel and spectral density both for
convenience and for use in some upcoming heuristic tools for selecting the
maximum resolved frequency Î©, which is a central concept in the paper and
directly controls the tradeoff between how far into the tails of the SDF you can
estimate and the size of the bias.
```julia
using IrregularSpectra

# Generate n uniform points on [a, b]:
n      = 3000
(a, b) = (-1.0, 1.0)
pts    = sort(rand(n).*(b-a) .+ a)

# Simulate a Matern process at those points with m replicates:
m   = 500 # number of replicates
sim = let kernel = (x,y)->IrregularSpectra.matern_cov(x-y, (1.0, 0.1, 1.75))
  IrregularSpectra.simulate_process(pts, kernel, m)
end
```
From here, the estimator is easy to obtain: select the window function we wish
to use (and it is easy to bring your own!), and use the `estimate_sdf` function.
In this example we use a Kaiser window with half-bandwidth `6.0`, which is a
good default choice for samples that don't have big gaps (see below for
gap-friendly alternatives). The function `estimate_sdf`, if given multiple iid
samples as columns in `sims`, will average the multiple estimates.

```julia
window    = Kaiser(6.0, a=a, b=b)
estimator = estimate_sdf(pts, sims, window)
```
The return object `estimator` is a `IrregularSpectra.SpectralDensityEstimator`.
Similar to return types in `DSP.jl` and others, you can summarize it with things
like 
```julia
plot(estimator.freq, estimator.sdf, [... your other kwargs ...])
```
The other internal components in that struct are subject to change, but
hopefully at least these two fields of `freq` and `sdf` will now be stable.

The script document in `./examples/simple_demo.jl` just uses printing as a
diagnostic, but here is a visual one where we estimate at more frequencies (this
plot was made with my own wrapper of Gnuplot that uses sixel output, but
substitute with your preferred plotting tool):
```julia
truth = IrregularSpectra.matern_sdf.(many_est_freqs, Ref((1.0, 0.1, 1.75)))
est1  = estimate_sdf(pts, sims[:,1], window)
gplot(est1.freq, est1.sdf, estimator.sdf, truth, ylog=true)
```

</p>

This plot shows the estimator from a single sample (purple), the average
estimate from `m=500` replicates is shown in blue (indicating that the bias in
the estimate is minimal compared to its expected value), and the true SDF is
shown in green.

# Irregular data with large gaps

If you have irregular data with gaps, you are much better off using a
(generalized) prolate function, which can be yield estimator weights whose norm
is dramatically smaller than a standard Kaiser window and thus yield estimators
with significantly lower bias. The above example can be very gently modified for
this case as follows:

```julia
using IrregularSpectra

# Your irregularly sampled points and measurements, loaded in however you do it:
pts   = [...] # your measurement locations
data  = [...] # your measurement values 

# identify support intervals using some default heuristics (you can also provide
your own precise intervals), then just create the window and proceed as usual:
intervals = gappy_intervals(pts)
window    = Prolate1D(intervals) # defaults for ~1-4 good tapers depending on gaps
estimator = estimate_sdf(pts, data, window)
```

You should be mindful in selecting the highest frequency to estimate, as the
continuous Nyquist frequency will be capped as the smallest value for each
segment. See `./examples/gaps_prolate.jl` for a full example.

**NOTE:** This prolate function method is useful for handling gaps, but there
are sampling circumstances where it simply does not make sense to compute one
joint estimator. If you have 1M points on `(0, 0.1)`, for example, you can
resolve exceptionally high frequencies...but your window function will need to
have a bandwidth on the order of hundreds or thousands to be well concentrated.
And if you have `1000` points on `(10, 100)`, your can make a window with a
fabulously small bandwidth but it will not be able to resolve high frequencies.
In a setting like that, we suggest computing and analyzing two separate
estimators for each measured interval.

**NOTE:** a less sophisticated 2D prolate window is also available. See the
example files for a demonstration.

# Experimental features/interfaces

## Accelerated preconditioning for large datasets

Using the extremely powerful
[`Krylov.jl`](https://github.com/juliasmoothoptimizers/Krylov.jl) 
and [`FINUFFT.jl`](https://github.com/ludvigak/FINUFFT.jl) packages, this
package computes weights in `O(n \log n)` time for `n` points...assuming that
your preconditioner is also at least as asymptotically fast. For good
performance at small data sizes, the default preconditioner is a fully dense
Cholesky-based option, which due to the extreme efficiency of LAPACK is not only
better in terms of lower iteration counts but faster until data sizes of `n`
around 5-10k.

For larger datasets, however, the dense preconditioner is not feasible. This
package offers a multitude of preconditioner extensions, although several of
them are internal objects that are sufficiently experimental that we do not
advise using them unless you are also developing/researching in this space. The
recommended preconditioning accelerators in one and two dimensions are as
follows:

### One dimension: [`HMatrices.jl`](https://github.com/IntegralEquations/HMatrices.jl) 
To use this preconditioner, you modify your above code by adding the weakdep of
`HMatrices.jl` and manually providing a solver with
```julia
using HMatrices
solver = KrylovSolver(HMatrixPreconditioner(1e-12, 1e-12))
est    = estimate_sdf(pts, sims, window; solver=solver)
```

### Two dimension: [`NearestNeighbors.jl`](https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl) 
The associated preconditioner with this extension is the `SparsePreconditioner`,
which thanks to `NearestNeighbors.jl` can perform the necessary queries for fast
assembly and factorization. To use this preconditioner, please modify your
code by adding the weakdep of `NearestNeighbors.jl` and manually providing a solver
with
```julia
using NearestNeighbors
solver = KrylovSolver(SparsePreconditioner(1e-12))
est    = estimate_sdf(pts, sims, window; solver=solver)
```

And you're good to go! **See the example files for a complete demonstration.**


## Automatic gap splitting in 1D

Given an arbitrary collection of sorted points in 1D `pts`,
`gappy_intervals(pts; kwargs...)` attempts to automatically identity
sub-intervals of `(pts[1], pts[end])` without significant gaps and returns the
result in the format required for the `Prolated1D` constructor:
```julia 
  using IrregularSpectra
  pts    = sort(vcat(rand(1000).*2.0 .- 1.0, rand(2000).*4.0 .+ 8.0))
  ivs    = gappy_intervals(pts)
  window = Prolate1D(ivs) # Prolate with (half-)bandwidth of 5
  [...] # downstream tasks
```

## Automatic multitaper estimators in 1D

If you pick a generous enough bandwidth that multiple prolate functions have
good concentration, `IrregularSpectra.jl` will automatically provide you with a
[multitaper estimator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitaper). A default
bandwidth is selected, but you can also provide your own. The number of tapers
is automatically selected by checking the concentration of each function.

Please note that, unlike in the well-behaved gridded 1D case, estimating the SDF
for processes observed at irregular locations and an SDF supported on the entire
real line means dramatically reducing how far in the spectrum you can safely
look. For this reason, cranking up the bandwidth and trying to use many tapers
can produce more dramatic visible artifacts.

## Automatic detection of data on a gappy grid

Irregular sampling from a gappy grid is a very special case of the more general
irregular sampling problem that this package aims to offer functionality for.
With that in mind, we have implemented prototype heuristic tools for detecting
whether the given locations are on a gappy grid and automatically exploiting the
available speedups in that case.

# Roadmap

This software library is under very active development. An incomplete list of
features to expect in the near future:

- An interface for providing arbitrary points in arbitrary dimensions and
  obtaining prolate function evaluations and right-hand sides for weight
  calculation. This is done _except_ for the step of a designing a robust function
  for automatically obtaining a quadrature rule on the point domain given just
  points. But good tools exist for triangulation-based methods, and so we just
  need to hook into them. Contributions in this space would certainly be welcome.
